## ðŸš€ Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed before getting started:

- **Salesforce CLI (sf CLI):** Latest version  
- **Node.js:** Version 18 or higher  
- **Git:** For version control  

---

## ðŸ§­ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/salesforce-pixel/advancedVoiceAnalysisAI.git
cd advancedVoiceAnalysisAI
```

### Step 2: Authenticate with Your Salesforce Org

```bash
sf org login web -a targetOrg
```

> **Note:** Replace `targetOrg` with your desired alias for the org.

### Step 3: Enable Required Features in the Org

Make sure the following features are enabled:

- **Generative AI (via Einstein Setup)**
- **Einstein for Sales**
- **Prompt Builder**
- **Service Cloud Voice**

### Step 4: Deploy the Project to Salesforce

```bash
sf project deploy start -x manifest/package.xml -o targetOrg -l NoTestRun
```

> This command deploys the metadata to your target org.

### Step 5: Configure Prompt Templates

After successful deployment, open the following two Prompt Templates (check out the genAiPromptTemplates folder in the codebase) and replace the placeholder comment in both these templates:

> `//Important: Add the Flow that provides Voice Call Transcript to this Prompt Template`

With the appropriate Flow reference:

1. ** XXX Voice Call Exploration**
   ```text
   {!$Flow:Query_Voice_Call_Transcript.Prompt}
   ```

2. ** XXX Voice AI Analysis**
   ```text
   {!$Flow:Query_Voice_Transcript_v2.Prompt}
   ```

âœ… Save both as **New Versions** and then **Activate** them.

### Step 6: Make the LWC available on the VoiceCall Object
* Open the VoiceCall record page in Lightning App Builder.
* Find voiceCallInsightViewer LWC, and drag and drop the component in a suitable location.
* Save and Activate
